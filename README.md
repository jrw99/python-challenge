# Python-Challenge
Repo for Python project

The solution herein contains scripts, resources and resulting output text files for the PyBank and PyPoll challenges.  The python scripts will run reading in data from csv files in the respective resources folder and will output results to both the console and to output text files in the respective analysis directories.  The PyPoll solution contains a jupyter notebook that was used just to visualize the csv file and can be ignored.
